# inv_system
This is a simple inventory management system I am building for my dad's body shop. The employees (Let's be real, my dad and I included) have had plenty of issues dealing with all of aspects of automotive parts with check-ins, ordering, and storage. This is a simple backend for now, and it will include a minimally styled front end to deomostrate the functionality. The ret of the front end will be built for use at the shop, or for other shops. 
Also, I am going to include a seperate part of the API that will be built for customers. This will allow customers to keep track of the progress on their vehicles. This will also help body shop owners with those pesky insurance companies. They love to be up to date with pictures about what they are spending their money on.
